## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by [Prof. Bo Wu](https://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/people/academic/wu-bo/index.asp). I obtained my bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology and my master's degree from Wuhan University respectively. 

Life is a journey, and I enjoy experiencing something different. I believe I will do better than I did yesterday.
